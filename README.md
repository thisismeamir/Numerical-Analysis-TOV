# Solving Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff Equations for Neutron Stars

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations and performing numerical analysis of neutron stars. Neutron stars are fascinating astrophysical objects with extreme conditions, and understanding their properties is crucial for astrophysics and our understanding of dense matter physics.

## Features

- **TOV Equations Solver**: Our code implements a solver for the TOV equations, which describe the equilibrium structure of a spherically symmetric, non-rotating neutron star.

- **Numerical Analysis**: We provide tools and scripts for performing numerical analysis on the solutions obtained from the TOV equations. This includes calculating mass-radius relationships, central density profiles, and other relevant quantities.

- **Visualization**: We offer visualization tools to create plots and graphs that illustrate the physical properties of neutron stars based on the numerical solutions.

- **Physics and Quantum Insights**: As a repository maintained by a user with a strong background in physics and quantum mechanics, we delve into the theoretical aspects and foundations that underlie the TOV equations and their relevance in astrophysics.
